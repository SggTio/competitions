In SQL, you will be given a table letters, with a string column letter. Return the sum of the letters in a column letter.

    Letters will always be lowercase.
    Letters can overflow (see second to last example of the description)
    If no letters are given, the function should return 'z'

SELECT COALESCE (CHR (CAST (( SUM (ascii(letter) - 96) - 1)%26 as INT) + 97), 'z')
as letter
from letters;
